For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (i.e. anything in the lectures to date, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting, or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.

there is not enough understanding in using of array, 
especailly in some detials. for example, the length of array,and index start at 0.
sometimes,I can get idea about how to solve the problems, 
but really hard to describe in the way of code. 
even I can describe it, still bugs exsit.
1.beginning homework early and if there are some problem, 
ask tutor or asking help from online help.
2.doing more practice different question in one feild. 
for example, array, I can find resourses at library to practice.   
3.it is really difficult to fix bug by myself.
